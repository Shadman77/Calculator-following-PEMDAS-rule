# First-Year-Structured-Programming-Project
A calculator which follows PEMDAS rule

This project was done for the Structured Programming Lab CCR 205L final project.
I thought myself GTK+ cross-platform GUI library and used it to create all the GUI components for this project.
This project was tested on both Windows and Linux OS and worked well and only needed to be compiled for each OS while the source code remained the same.
I did not know about postfix notation back then and therefore I did the project using string manipulation.
This calculator does not support exponentiation.
